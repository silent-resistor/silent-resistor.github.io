# > Who am I ? Good question...

My name is **Silent Resistor** - and no, I'm not a resistor from your electronics class (though I do resist sleep while learning new exploits).
I'm a **junior pentester** currently stuck in the "I have no idea what I'm doing, but it's working!" phase of my career. You know that feeling right, when you accedentally get root and have no idea what you did? Yeah, that's my daily life.

# > What I do (or Try to)
- **Learning** - Tryhackme rooms, Youtube are my primary source for learning, at 2AM in the night, because my brain won't shut up about that one flag I couldn't capture. Sleep? she left me. 
- **Solving CTFs** - Jomping between Rootme, OverTheWire, TryhackMe, and Hackthebox like I commitment issues. Which I really do.
- **Exploring** - Reading blogs about the CVEs I'll never understand and exploits I'll never use. But hey, I feel smart for 5 minutes at least.
- **Practicing** - 85% confusion, 9% querying AI, 5% Googling, 1% "wait, it worked?!" moments.

# > My Fun Facts:
- I talk to my terminal more than I talk to real people.
- I enjoy breaking things - legally, of course.
- Linux is my happy place. Windows confuses me.
- Dark mode everything. Always.
- Reverse shells make me happy.
- I collect VMs like others collect shoes.

## > My Goal

To pop shells, catch flags, and maybe one day get paid for breaking stuff instead of fixing it.
