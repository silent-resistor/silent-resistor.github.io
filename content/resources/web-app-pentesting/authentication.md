## Authentication Enumerations
-  `Identifying valid usernames`: observe response of login or password resets.
- `Password policies`: info when we enter password that does not match the policies, is used gauge the potential complexity of passwords and tailor strategy.
- `Common places to enerumerate`: 
    ```bash
    #registration pages, Fails if username already used. So, we can list of valid users.
    #Password reset features: Fails if username does not belong to valid account. Can list the valid usernames.
    #Verbose Errors: these intential errors can provide us the info about whether valid user, valid pass??
    # Data Breach info: data from previous breaches is goldmine, allows us to find whether compromised credentials are reused across the platforms. 

## Enumerating Users via Verbose errors
- Verbose errors can turn into a goldmine of information, providing insights such as: `Internal Paths`, `Database details like spilling secrets`, `User information` etc
- `Inducing verbose errors`: forcing application to reveal its secrets by using belwo techniques.
   ```
    Invalid login attempts
    SQL injections
    File Inclusion/Path Traversal
    FOrm Manupulation
    Application Fuzzing
    ```
- `Role of enumeration and brute forcing`: User Enumerations, Exploiting versbose errors.
    ```bash
    cd sources/
    git clone git@github.com:nyxgeek/username-lists.git
    python3 email_bruteforce.py "username-lists/usernames-top100/usernames_gmail.com.txt"
    ```
## Exploiting Vulnerable Password Reset Logic
#### Password Reset Flow Vulnerabilities
- Email-Based Reset
- Security Question-Based Reset
- SMS-Based Reset

## OSINT 
- Wayback urls
- Think of the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine (https://archive.org/web/) as a time machine
- To dump all of the links that are saved in Wayback Machine, we can use the tool called waybackurls.
- git clone https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls
- cd waybackurls
- sudo apt install golang-go -y
- ls -la 
- ./waybackurls tryhackme.com
