## Introduction
- Prototype pollution allowd bad actors to manipulate and exploit the inner workings of Javascript applications and enables attackers to gain access to sensitive data and application backend.
- While this vulnerability is mostly discussed in context of Javascript, the concept can apply to any system that uses similar **Prototype based inheritance model**.
- However, Javascript's widespread use, particularly in web development, and its flexible and dynamic object model make prototype pollution a more prominent and relevant concern in this language.
- In contrast, **class-based inheritance** languages like Java, C++ have a different model of inheritance where classes (blueprints of objects) are typically static, and altering a class at a runtime to affect all its instances is not a common practice or straight forward task.
