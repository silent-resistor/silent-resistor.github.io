# Crunch
- Crunch can generate all possible combinations and permutations according to given criteria.
- Basic Usage:
  `crunch <min> <max> [options]`
- `min` and `max` are minimu and maximum length of string you want the cruch to start.
- You can usually find the charset.lst file in the /usr/share/crunch directory if you have Crunch installed on your system.

## Examples
```bash
# Example1: Crunch displays a wordlist that starts at `a` and ends at `zzzzzzzz`
crunch 1 8


# Example2: Crunch display a wordlist using character set `abcdefg` that starts at  `a` and ends at `gggggg`
crunch 1 6 abcdefg


# Example3: there is a space at the end of the character string.
# inorder for crunch  to use the space you will need to escape it using the `\` character. In this exampleyou could also put quotes around the letter and not need the `\`. i.e. "abcdefg ".
cruch 1 6 abcdefg\


# Example4: crunch will use the mixalpha-numeric-all-space character set from charset.lst and will write the wordlist to a file named wordlist.txt. The file will start witl `a` and end with "        ".
cruch 1 8 -f /usr/share/crunch/charset.lst mixalpha-numeric-all-space -o wordlist.txt


#Example5: Now same as above, but we use patten to filter out.
# now file start at `cbddogaaa` and end at `  dog   `
# -t --> to specify the pattern
# -s --> Specifies a starting string
crunch 8 8 -f /usr/share/crunch/charset.lst mixalpha-numeric-all-space -o wordlist.txt -t @@dog@@@ -s cbdogaaa


# Example 7. The numbers aren't processed but are needed:
#When you use the -p flag with characters, Crunch focuses on permutations of the specified string for all possible lengths. ( no repetition of charaters)
cruch 4 5 -p abc

# Example8: crunch will generate bzip2 compressed files with each file containing 6000 words.
# -c 6000: This option defines the number of words that will be written to the output file at a time.
# wordlist.txt is bzip compressed, uncompress it with bzip2 -d wordlist.txt
crunch 1 5 -o wordlist.txt -c 6000 -z bzip2


#Example 10. will generate 4 files: aaaa-gvfed.txt, gvfee-ombqy.txt, ombqz-wcydt.txt, wcydu-zzzzz.txt the first three files are 20MBs (real power of 2 MegaBytes) and the last file is 11MB.
crunch 4 5 -b 20mib -o wordlist.txt
